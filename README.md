<h3>Introduce DDos</h3>
<h4>-> A DoS Attack is an attack in which a person renders a system unusable, or significantly slows it down for the average user, by overloading the system's resources.</h4> <h4>-> If the attacker is not able to penetrate the system, then they try to find a way to make the system crash and not be able to serve normal users that is Denial of Service (DoS) attack.</h4>
<h4>-> Although a DoS attack does not have access to the actual data of the system, it can disrupt the services that the system provides. As defined on DoS, when attacking a system, it will exploit the weakest points of the system to attack</h4>
