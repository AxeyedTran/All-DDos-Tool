<h4>This tool is for learning only, we recommend you not to use it for bad deeds. If something happens to you, we will not be responsible</h4>
<h3>All DDos Tool Created from 2014 to 2021</h3>
<h3>Introduce DDos</h3>

<li><h4>A DoS Attack is an attack in which a person renders a system unusable, or significantly slows it down for the average user, by overloading the system's resources.</h4> <li><h4>If the attacker is not able to penetrate the system, then they try to find a way to make the system crash and not be able to serve normal users that is Denial of Service (DoS) attack.</h4></li>
<li><h4>Although a DoS attack does not have access to the actual data of the system, it can disrupt the services that the system provides. As defined on DoS, when attacking a system, it will exploit the weakest points of the system to attack</h4></li>

<h3>How does a DDoS Attack Work?</h3>
<li><h4>DDoS attacks exploit networks of internet-connected devices to cut off users from a server or network resource, such as a website or application they may frequently access.</h4></li>
<li><h4>To launch a DDoS attack, attackers use malware or take advantage of security vulnerabilities to maliciously infect and gain control over machines and devices. Each computer or infected device, called a “bot” or “zombie,” becomes capable of spreading the malware further and participating in DDoS attacks. These bots form bot armies called “botnets” that leverage their strength in numbers and amplify the size of an attack. And because the infection of IoT devices often goes unnoticed — just like that pesky B movie zombie that you didn’t realize was infected — legitimate device owners become secondary victims or unknowing participants, while attackers remain hard to identify by the victimized organization.</h4></li>
<li><h4>Once an attacker has built a botnet, they are able to send remote instructions to each bot,
directing a DDoS attack on the target system. When a botnet attacks a network or server, the attacker instructs individual bots to send requests to the victim’s IP address. Just as we humans have one-of-a-kind fingerprints, our devices have a unique address that identifies them on the internet or local network. The result of overwhelming traffic leads to a denial of service, preventing normal traffic from accessing the website, web application, API, or network.</h4>
<li><h4>Sometimes botnets, with their networks of compromised devices, are rented out for other potential attacks through “attack-for-hire” services. This allows people with malicious intent but no training or experience to easily launch DDoS attacks on their own.</h4></li>
